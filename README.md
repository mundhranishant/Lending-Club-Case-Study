## General Information
- This analysis dives deep into loan data to uncover patterns related to loan defaults.
- The project addresses the business problem of high default rates in lending by leveraging predictive analytics.
- We used a comprehensive dataset detailing borrower attributes, loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment statuses.

## Conclusions
- Loan purpose, especially small business loans, significantly affects default rates.
- Higher debt-to-income ratios correlate with increased likelihood of default.
- Borrowers with long employment lengths do not necessarily have lower default rates.
- Implementing targeted risk assessment strategies for loan purposes and debt management can reduce default rates.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8
- Pandas for data manipulation
