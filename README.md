# Lending-Club-Case-Study

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a loan dataset to identify factors influencing loan default rates. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we delve into various borrower attributes and loan characteristics to discern patterns and insights that can inform lending decisions.

## Objectives
- To understand the distribution of loan amounts, interest rates, employment lengths, and annual incomes in the dataset.
- To examine the relationship between loan status and variables such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, annual income, and loan utilization rate.
- To explore the impact of home ownership and loan purpose on the likelihood of loan default.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Initial data preparation involved removing columns with excessive missing values, converting data types for analysis, and handling missing data.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed the distributions of key variables individually.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Investigated the relationships between loan status and other significant variables.
- **Derived Metrics**: Calculated additional metrics such as the debt-to-income ratio and loan utilization rate for deeper insights.

## Key Findings
- **Loan Amount and Interest Rate Distributions**: Provided insights into the financial characteristics of the loans.
- **Employment Length and Annual Income Distributions**: Helped understand borrower demographics.
- **Loan Status Relationships**: Showed how loan amount, interest rate, employment length, annual income, and loan utilization rate are related to loan default risks.
- **Home Ownership and Loan Purpose**: Revealed the influence of borrower's home ownership status and loan purpose on default rates.
- **Loan Utilization Rate vs Loan Status**: Highlighted the correlation between higher loan utilization rates (approximated by the DTI ratio) and increased risk of default.

## Conclusion
The findings from this analysis offer valuable insights for lenders, contributing to risk assessment and decision-making processes in the loan industry. Identifying factors that influence loan defaults can help in developing better lending policies and risk management strategies.

## Visualization Insights
The project includes a series of visualizations that illustrate the distributions of key variables and their relationships with loan status, providing a visual summary of the analysis findings.
